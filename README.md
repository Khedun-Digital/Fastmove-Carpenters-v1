# Fastmove Carpenters Website

This site is structured for GitHub Pages hosting.

## Structure

- `index.html` — Main site entry point (must be at root for GitHub Pages)
- `assets/` — For static assets (e.g., Open Graph images, custom CSS/JS, etc.). Place production-only binaries (like the logo and hero background) here locally; they are ignored by Git so you can upload them directly in your hosting platform without committing.
- `images/` — For gallery and portfolio images (upload your images here)

## How to use
- Upload your gallery images to the `images/` folder.
- Place any custom assets (e.g., logo, favicon, Open Graph images) in the `assets/` folder.
- The site is ready for GitHub Pages. Just push to your repository and enable Pages from the root.

## Example
- `assets/og-cover-carpenters.jpg` — Used for social sharing (see meta tags in `index.html`).
- `images/` — Add your before/after project photos here for the portfolio section.
